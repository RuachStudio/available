    <p>6 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple.</p>
    <p>2 Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.</p>
    <p>3 And they were calling to one another:</p>
    <blockquote style="margin:8px 0; font-style:italic;">‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.‚Äù</blockquote>
    <p>4 At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.</p>
    <p>5 ‚ÄúWoe to me!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúI am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.‚Äù</p>
    <p>6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.</p>
    <p>7 With it he touched my mouth and said, ‚ÄúSee, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.‚Äù</p>
    <p>8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‚ÄúWhom shall I send? And who will go for us?‚Äù</p>
    <p>And I said, ‚ÄúHere am I. Send me!‚Äù</p>
